          Cidwell Capital takes reasonable steps to safeguard your Personal
          Information through physical, electronic, and operational policies and
          practices. Data can only be read or written through defined service

          security of the data is achieved through a combination of network
          firewalls (there is no direct communication allowed between the
          database server and the Internet) and servers with operating systems,
          all housed in a secure facility.Access to the system is controlled.
          Employees are granted access to Personal Information on a need-to-know
          basis in order to perform a specific job (for example, billing or

          Information transmitted online, as well as offline. When we contact
          you about your account or to confirm a funds transfer, we only
          reference the last four digits of your social security number. The
          computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable
          information are kept in a secure environment.We will also ensure the

          INTERNATIONAL USERS

          The Site is hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Site
          from outside the United States, by providing your information to the
          Site, you are consenting to and authorizing the transfer of your
          information to the United States for storage, use, processing,

          <br />

          logged out of the Site automatically after a specified period of

        <p className="paragraph1">
          WHAT YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
          <br />
          In addition to our own efforts, you can take several precautions to
          protect the security of your computer and Personal Information. For
          instance, you should create and use a complex password, using numbers,
          a combination of small and large capital letters, and special
          characters. You should avoid using any information that others can
          easily learn about you, such as your mother’s maiden name, a family
          member’s name or birthday. We also recommend that you change your
          password frequently. You should never share your password with anyone,
          or leave it written down in an unsecure area.You can also install and
          regularly update antivirus and firewall software to protect your
          computer or device from external attacks by malicious users. If you
          use a computer that can be accessed in a public area (e.g., library,
          coffee shop, etc.), we recommend that you take special precautions to
          protect the security of your account and Personal Information. When
          you are finished visiting our Site, you should log out completely,
          close the browser window and clear the browser’s cache files.You
          should also be aware of fraudulent attempts to gain access to your
          account information known as “phishing.” Phishing is a tactic used by
          scammers to lure people to a phony website through the use of a
          genuine-looking email purporting to be from a legitimate company.
          Either in the email itself or on this fake website site, scammers will
          ask for login information to gain access to people’s accounts and
          withdraw their money. Cidwell Capital will never ask you for your login
          information in the context of any email. In general, you can protect
          yourself against phishing by never providing login or Personal
          Information via an email. You should always ensure the Cidwell Capital URL
          that you are provided begins with: https://www.Cidwellcapitalgroup.com
          or https://www.Cidwellcapitalgroup.com.
